# evm_experiments

pyevm_breakup is the notebook version of pyevm coded by the guys at MIT. It allows for modding the functions a little bit and playing around


signal_process uses similar ideas but detrends and normalizes. It uses mpl clickers to allow you to choose the region of interest
It also pickles the data and stores it

filters.ipynb takes the pickeled data and does the post signal processing
